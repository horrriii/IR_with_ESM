# Infrared_with_ESM

This package is designed for the calculation and analysis of infrared absorption spectra in conjunction with the effective screening medium (ESM) method developed by Otani and Sugino (M. Otani and O. Sugino, Phys. Rev. B 73, 115407 (2006)). By using this package, more accurate infrared absorption spectra of adsorbates on slab surfaces can be obtained. In addition, the package enables the calculation of infrared absorption spectra in solvent environments within the framework of the ESM–RISM method developed by Nishihara and Otani (S. Nishihara and M. Otani, Phys. Rev. B 96, 115429 (2007)).

During the development of this package, we drew significant inspiration from VibIR-Parallel-Compute, developed by K. I. M. Rojas (K. I. M. Rojas, Y. Morikawa, and I. Hamada, J. Open Source Softw. 10(108), 7855 (2025)), a former member of our research group. We would like to express our sincere gratitude for his valuable contributions.

## Getting started
